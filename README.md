## Activity Analysis Features

### Enhanced Data Visualization
- **Pace Analysis**: Detailed pace charts using GPS stream data (more accurate than split-based)
- **Elevation Profile**: Continuous elevation data from GPS streams
- **Heart Rate Tracking**: Real-time heart rate data throughout the activity
- **Heart Rate Zone Distribution**: Visual breakdown of time spent in each HR zone with color-coded intensity levels
- **Relative Effort Analysis**: Weighted effort scoring based on heart rate zone distribution with physiological multipliers
- **Speed Analysis**: Velocity data with smooth curves
- **Stream Data Indicator**: Shows whether detailed GPS/sensor data is available
- **LLM Data Export**: One-click generation of structured activity summaries for AI analysis and coaching insights

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: GPS and sensor stream data (time, distance, latlng, altitude, velocity, heart rate)
- **Fallback**: Split-based data when streams are unavailable
- **Automatic Caching**: Stream data is cached locally for offline access

## Heart Rate Zone Analysis

### Zone-Based Training Insights
- **5-Zone Heart Rate System**: Recovery, Aerobic Base, Aerobic, Lactate Threshold, Neuromuscular Power
- **Age-Based Max HR Calculation**: Uses standard 220-age formula (configurable birth year in settings)
- **Visual Zone Distribution**: Color-coded pie chart showing time spent in each intensity zone
- **Zone Color Coding**: Blue (easy) â†’ Green (moderate) â†’ Yellow (tempo) â†’ Orange (hard) â†’ Red (maximum)

### Relative Effort Scoring System
The app calculates a sophisticated effort score that goes beyond simple time or average heart rate:

#### Zone Multipliers
- **Zone 1 (Recovery)**: Ã—1 multiplier - Light blue
- **Zone 2 (Aerobic Base)**: Ã—2 multiplier - Green  
- **Zone 3 (Aerobic)**: Ã—3 multiplier - Yellow
- **Zone 4 (Lactate Threshold)**: Ã—5 multiplier - Orange
- **Zone 5 (Neuromuscular Power)**: Ã—8 multiplier - Red

#### Key Metrics
- **Total Effort Points**: Cumulative weighted score for entire activity
- **Relative Effort Score**: Normalized effort per hour for cross-activity comparison
- **Intensity Factor**: Average intensity rating (0-8 scale)
- **Physiological Weighting**: Higher zones contribute exponentially more points, reflecting real metabolic cost

This system allows meaningful comparison between different workout types - a short intense interval session can have similar effort scores to longer moderate-paced activities.

## LLM Summary & AI Analysis

### Intelligent Data Export
The app includes a sophisticated LLM summary feature that generates structured, AI-ready summaries of your activities:

#### Core Features
- **One-Click Export**: Generate comprehensive activity summaries with the "ðŸ“‹ LLM Summary" button
- **Structured Format**: Machine-readable data format optimized for language model analysis
- **Comprehensive Context**: Includes activity metrics, heart rate zones, effort scoring, and yearly performance context
- **Custom Prefixes**: Configure personalized prompts in Settings to guide AI analysis toward specific coaching goals

#### Data Included in Summaries
- **Activity Basics**: Name, type, date, distance, time, speed, elevation
- **Heart Rate Analysis**: Zone distribution percentages, average HR, max HR calculations
- **Effort Metrics**: Relative effort points, intensity factors, physiological weighting
- **Yearly Context**: Complete activity history for the same year with performance trends
- **Performance Patterns**: Activity type distribution, training load analysis, comparative metrics

#### Example Use Cases
- **AI Coaching**: "Analyze this data as a professional running coach and suggest training improvements..."
- **Performance Trends**: "Review my yearly training data and identify patterns in my fitness progression..."
- **Recovery Planning**: "Based on my recent activities and effort scores, recommend optimal recovery strategies..."
- **Goal Setting**: "Help me plan my next training phase based on my current fitness metrics..."

#### Technical Format
Summaries are generated in a structured format that language models can easily parse:
```
Activity: Morning Run (Run) on 2025-08-27 - Distance: 10.5km, Time: 45m 30s, 
HR_zones:[Recovery:15%,Aerobic_Base:35%,Aerobic:30%,Threshold:20%], 
relative_effort:320pts

Year_2025_context: Total_activities:45, Total_distance:456.7km, 
Activity_types:[Run:35,Ride:8,Swim:2], All_year_activities:[...]
```

This enables sophisticated AI analysis of training patterns, performance trends, and personalized coaching recommendations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Strava App

1. Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Create a new app or use an existing one
3. Set the **Authorization Callback Domain** to: `localhost` (for development) or your domain for production
4. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

5. You'll be redirected to Strava to authorize access
6. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to the app

### 4. Configure Additional Settings

- **Birth Year**: Set your birth year for accurate heart rate zone calculations
- **LLM Summary Prefix**: Customize the prompt prefix for AI analysis (e.g., "Analyze this as a professional coach...")
- **Data Management**: Export/import your activity data for backup or transfer

### 5. Explore Your Data
